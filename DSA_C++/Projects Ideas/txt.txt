Top 9 C++ Project Ideas with Source Code


Beginner-Level C++ Project Ideas


1. Simple Calculator

Functionality:
 Build a basic calculator program that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation, and then display the result.

Skills Required:

Basic understanding of C++ syntax
Arithmetic operations
Input/output handling
Source Code: https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator


2. Number Guessing Game
Functionality: 
Create a simple number-guessing game where the computer generates a random number between a specified range, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. Provide feedback to the player on whether their guess is too high or too low.

Skills Required:

Conditional statements
Loops
Random number generation

8. Computer Graphics Engine
Functionality: 
Create a computer graphics engine capable of rendering 2D and 3D graphics using techniques like rasterization or ray tracing. Implement features such as geometric transformations, lighting models, texture mapping, and shading algorithms to generate visually appealing images.

Skills Required:

Mathematics (linear algebra, geometry)
Graphics programming
Algorithm optimization
Source Code: https://github.com/topics/rendering-enginee

9. Distributed Systems Framework
Functionality: 
Develop a distributed systems framework for building scalable and fault-tolerant networked applications. Design modules for communication protocols, load balancing, fault detection, and data replication to enable the development of distributed applications across multiple nodes.

Skills Required:

Network programming
Concurrent programming
